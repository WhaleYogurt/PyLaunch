# termarcade

A tiny terminal UI + OBJ spinner library with color, non-blocking input, and a cacheable ASCII 3D viewer.

- **TerminalApp** — simple render/update/input loop (you fully control it)
- **MenuWidget** — arrow-key menus with custom rendering
- **OBJSpinner** — load **any `.obj`**, build a trimmed ASCII frame cache, and play it smoothly
- Ships with a **default Lambda (Λ)** model; pass your own OBJ path to override

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e .
python scripts/launcher.py                         # built-in Lambda
python scripts/launcher.py path/to/model.obj       # custom OBJ
python scripts/launcher.py --rebuild path/to.obj   # force rebuild

python examples/snake/snake.py                     # run the Snake demo
